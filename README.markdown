#projection mapping with Unity3D

Greetings! You have stumbled upon my projection mapping experiments in Unity 3D.
The project contains scripts and shaders used to implement homographic transformations natively within Unity 3D. 

##useful links

2. Vertex operations in shaders: http://bit.ly/NnSKaQ

3. Mapping to the physical world: http://bit.ly/bsJo01

##install 

If you wish to run the project, install Unity 3D, clone this repository, and double-click on the scene file at Assets > Scenes.

##instructions

Once you hit play, left-click and drag one of the 4 red controllers on on the vertices of the cube to warp the camera perspective.
