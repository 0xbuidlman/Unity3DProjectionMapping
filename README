Greetings! You have stumbled upon my projection mapping experiments in Unity 3D.
The project contains scripts and shaders used to implement homographic transformations natively within Unity 3D. 

If you wish to run the project, install Unity 3D, then download and double-click on the scene file at Assets > Scenes.

3. Mapping to the physical world: http://vvvv.org/documentation/how-to-project-on-3d-geometry

Instructions:
Once you hit play, left-click and drag one of the 4 red controllers on on the vertices of the cube to warp the camera perspective.
